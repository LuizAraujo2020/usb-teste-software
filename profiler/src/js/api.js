<br>
<br>I'm from Brasilia, Brazil, born and raised. I can describe myself as determined, because I'm resilient, always trying to do the best with everything that life brings... I like to listen to music, read, and do outdoor activities. I volunteer whenever possible and I am a passionate type of person, about a lot of things. I almost died a few times and I've saved some lives, and these events have made me see life with a new perspective, now I finally feel that I am starting to understand what life is really about.
<br>
<br>I have had a few jobs, and each one has given me some important skills, and I am glad to have had these experiences. I am now more participative and communicative, for example. I am a hardworking, honest, imaginative, innovative, motivated and reliable professional. I try to be empathetic, creative, energetic, flexible, passionate, and I also try to have a good and healthy sense of humor. Furthermore, I like treating people with respect, I like helping people and I like learning new things, especially when it comes to technology. 
<br>
<br>I am currently working as a iOS Developer on a company called Eldorado, where I am being part of teams that Develop Apps and Games, natively. Also, I am a volunteer, currently I am teaching digital literacy, helping those who doesn't know how to use a computer and a smartphone, those who don't feel able to do the basic things on the internet and I am doing this because, in my humble opinion, it is one of the most present forms of exclusion and segregation, since they are afraid of the technology and the devices because they don't even know how to start learning how to use them and I realized that this makes them feel excluded, deprived of an increasingly technological world.`;
